        In 1994, when blogs began, a blog was more of a personal diary that
        people shared online. In this online journal, you could talk about your
        daily life or share about things that you were doing. Then, people saw
        an opportunity to communicate information in a new way online. Thus
        began the beautiful world of blogging..<br />
